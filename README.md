# AnalyzeStack

AnalyzeStack is a tool for analyzing the goroutines stack which is generated by /debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2.

In a Go program, there may be hundreds or even thousands of goroutines.

It uniques the stacks and count the number of goroutines, then sort them by the number of goroutines.

It can be used to find the goroutines which are blocking the program quickly.

It helps to know what kind of goroutines are running in the program.

usage:

- take one or more stack files as input
    ```bash
    analyzestack <stack-file-path>...
    ```

- take pipeline input
    ```bash
    cat <stack-file-path> | analyzestack
    ```
